**1.  What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

I think the most interesting thing we have covered thus far is the concept of a climate model emulator. If trained correctly, these can mimic the output of actual climate models, which take a much larger amount of time and money to run. By using an emulator, we can save oursevles a lot of time and trouble to explore many different variations of possible climates.

**2.  Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

My group and I have been discussing a project in which we use emulators to predict natural disaster risk for a handful (1-3) so-called "high impact" regions. We would basically build models to assess the risk of a particular natural disaster, then use the emulator data to examine how that changes under different climate futures. We will also examine the by-region uncertainty of each emulator output to understand the spread of the different emulator models.

**3.  What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change that I would make to the approach currently being taken is to explored a wider breadth of models. Right now we have been doing a deep dive individually into a single emulator model, but I think once we get the hang of one, we should begin to look at the inner working of the other models so we can understand potential tradeoffs between the different types of emulators.

**4.  What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

There is a CNN emulator model, but I have not yet tried to work with it, so that is something I am interested in looking at. I have never worked with CNN's before, and DSC 140B (next quarter) will be my first official class on deep learning models, so I want to familiarize myself with these kinds of models since they are an important class of machine learning models that are widely implemented.
